Kendrick uses this ballad to ask the essential questions to his partner to solidify the most important aspect of their relationship: love.

             Kendrick has kept his relationship with Alford under wraps for a majority of his career. It wasn’t until 2016 that word got out that he was engaged.</p>

             "Drew had a friend from the East coast who had been struggling with a drug addiction for the past few years. He was a childhood friend and their families were close, so his parents kept him informed on how he was doing. He and Drew would keep in touch on Facebook chat but would never speak about what he was going through, but meanwhile Drew knew of all the craziness that surrounded his friend's life.</p>

Their friends can see that these two are not meant for each other, but the couple fails to fight their instant gut feelings.
             The girl says they have certain expectations of their relationship. At a glance, it seems as if the partner is able to cater to all these requirements. But that’s what ‘the thing in their chest’ says. Not that ‘the thing in your chest’ is always wrong. But you have to give reigns to the head when jumping into a relationship.</p>
